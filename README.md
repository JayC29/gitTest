# Chess-starter-project

11/6 - Starter project is up, I put together 2 scripts, MoveSelector.cs and TileSelector.cs, which are not totally complete yet, refer to the link in the GroupMe to finish up the code for those scripts. So far, we can highlight and move pieces - they just aren't legal moves yet.
